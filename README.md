- **React 17:** Library for building declarative and reactive user interfaces.
- **React Router:** For managing routes within the SPA.
- **Bootstrap + Reactstrap:** For creating a responsive layout and modern UI components.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust relational database used in the production environment.
- **SQL Server LocalDB:** Used for the local development environment on Windows.

### Infrastructure & Deployment (DevOps)
- **Docker:** The application is containerized to ensure consistency between environments.

## ðŸ“¦ Running the Project Locally

Follow the steps below to run the application on your local machine.

### âœ… Prerequisites
- **.NET 6 SDK**
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- An instance of **SQL Server LocalDB** (usually installed with Visual Studio)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gvmzin/GerenciadorTarefas.git
cd GerenciadorTarefas
````

### 2. Configure and Create the Local Database

The project is configured to use SQL Server LocalDB by default for development.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend project folder
cd GerenciadorTarefas 

# Use Entity Framework to create the database and its tables
dotnet ef database update
```

### 3. Start the Backend

Open a terminal in the backend project folder (`/GerenciadorTarefas`).

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API server will start at `https://localhost:7201` (check the exact port in the terminal output).

### 4. Start the Frontend

Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend folder.

```bash
cd ClientApp

# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
```

The React application will start at `http://localhost:3000` and will automatically connect to the backend via the configured proxy.
